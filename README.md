Some Data analyst work on data from OurWorldInData.org url = https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths from 24-02-2020 to 16-01-2022
Extracted from csv, done some basic changes on excel, deleted some tables, then imported to microsoft sql server and preformed these querys to get some insight on the data.
Then I use Tableu to visualise the data better
